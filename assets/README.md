# /assets

This directory contains all the rich presence art assets RPCGecko uses. To add your own game icons or other assets, you'll need to create a new application in your [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers), upload your assets there, and change the application ID in RPCGecko's settings accordingly.

This might sound complex, but it's actually pretty simple. Check out [custom-assets.md](https://github.com/dmgrstuff/rpcgecko/blob/main/docs/custom-assets.md) for some more detailed instructions.
